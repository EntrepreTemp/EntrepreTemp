        <p>
          A start-up has a million projects that need to be done to further the business, but limited time and resources to complete them.  EntrepreTemp can handle those project and leave the founder and top management to focus elsewhere.</p>

        <p>
          My name is James Bierman.  I am a first year MBA at Olin Business School at Washington University of St. Louis.  I started EntrepreTemp to help start-ups that have projects which an MBA can complete, allowing the founder and management to focus on more pressing issues.  This might include a customer analysis, competitor analysis, market research, data analysis, or a combination of all four.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a civil engineering degree and spent 5 years at a large construction company including 2 years in various project lead roles.  During these last 2 years leading projects, I learned how to “get shit done” doing “whatever it takes,” (two very important phrases that stuck with me after my career in construction).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Since coming back to St. Louis, I've been actively involved in the expanding entrepreneurial community here.  Some of the projects I have been working on through the business school include helping to develop a business plan for the expansion of a nonprofit in North St. Louis, completing a competitor analysis for a local startup, and assisting a startup out of Hungary that is connected with a respected venture capital firm there.  Other skills that I can offer include coding and excel skills. </p>
          <p></p>
          
        <p>
          Below are some of the different ways I can help a startup.  I'm excited to use what I've been learning from my business school professor and well-known local venture capitalist, Cliff Holekamp, in combination with what I learned from my past project management experiences (“to get shit done”) to help a company grow. </p>

        <h2 id="sec1">Customer Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          You may need a customer analysis if you noticed a trend in the number of customers.  Are your sales conversion rates low?  Is your sales growth low?  Is your churn rate high?
        </p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can make and collect customer surveys, contact your customers, and analyze customer data to try to explain and/or fix a trend. </p>

        <h2 id="sec2">Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Every business has competitors, and startup companies are no different. 
          What does your competitor have that you don't?  Your competitors are doing (BLANK), what should you do?
        </p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can collect data on your competitor and analyze your competitors' strategy.  Then, EntrepreTemp can provide recommendations to how you should respond.  </p>

        <h2 id="sec3">Market Research</h2>
        <p>
          Most people think entrepreneurship is risky, but really, the more successful entrepreneurs hedge this risk with careful research.  Do you need some research to decide between the different paths your company might go?  Do you need to figure something out but don't have the time/resources to go out and get the data?</p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can do that research and find the right data for you. That can be anything from surveys to record-combing.  EntrepreTemp can do the due diligence on a target market to analyze its viability.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="sec4">Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Everybody is talking about data nowadays, and most likely, your startup is no different.  But, data is only good if you can find a way to glean a message.</p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can take the time to set up a way to not only read current data but also continue reading the data as your company grows.  I consider myself an "Excel-Ninja", with the "Ninja" part learned from many painful times doing excel in engineering.  Let me leverage my knowledge to help you avoid that pain. </p>
