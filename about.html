        <p>
          In order for a start-up to grow it needs to acquire customers, differentiate from its competitors, and organize its marketing.  Contact EntrepreTemp and let us help you plan all these pieces so that your company can take off! </p>
        
        <hr>
        <p>
          My name is James Bierman.  I started EntrepreTemp to help start-ups that have customer acquisition, marketing, and strategy projects which an MBA can complete, allowing the founder and management to focus on more pressing issues.  These projects might include a customer analysis, competitor analysis, market research, data analysis, or a combination of all four.  They can be long projects or projects that might take less than a week.
        </p>
        <p></p>
         <p>
          Since coming to St. Louis, I've been actively involved in the expanding entrepreneurial community.  I've worked on projects from around the world including for-profits and non-profits.  Some of the projects include developing comprehensive business plans, competitor analyses, and overall marketing strategies.</p>
          <p></p>
          
        <p>
          Below are some of the different ways I can help your startup.  I'm excited to help your company grow by taking care of the business aspects that all start-ups have but don't have time for. </p>

        <h2 id="sec1">How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Step 1: <a href="contactgoogle.html">Contact</a> - Email <a href="mailto:James.Bierman@WUSTL.edu?Subject=EntrepreTemp" target="_top">James.Bierman@WUSTL.edu</a> or Call (217) 341-6811 to set up a meeting.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Step 2: You and I will meet to discuss your business and how I might help you.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Step 3: I will estimate a duration and number of hours to complete the project.  That will give you a simple price for the project ($22 per hour). You know upfront what the extent of your costs are going to be.  Some introductory strategy projects can be done for as little as $1000.</p> 
        <p></p>  
        <p>Step 4: I will give status updates as often as you want.  Monthly? Biweekly? Daily?</p>
        <p>Step 5: I will give a final presentation at the end.  Your project is complete and you stayed focused on your other priorities.  There was no intern to keep busy over the summer, no business development personnel to hire, and key personnel weren't distracted.
        <p></p>

        <h2 id="sec2">Customer Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          You may need a customer analysis if you noticed a trend in the number of customers.  Are your sales conversion rates low?  Is your sales growth low?  Is your churn rate high?  Are you going after the right customers?
        </p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can make and collect customer surveys, contact your customers, and analyze customer data to try to explain and/or fix a trend. Once the right customers are found we can give you a marketing strategy that will help you maximize the acquistion of these customers.</p>       
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="sec3">Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Every business has competitors, and startup companies are no different. 
          What does your competitor have that you don't?  Your competitors are doing (BLANK), what should you do?
        </p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can collect data on your competitor and analyze your competitors' strategy.  Then, EntrepreTemp can provide recommendations to how you should respond.  </p>        
        <hr>
        
        <h2 id="sec4">Market Research/Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Most people think entrepreneurship is risky, but really, successful entrepreneurs hedge this risk with careful research.  Do you need some research to decide between the different paths your company might go?  Do you need to figure something out but don't have the time/resources to go out and acquire or analyze the data?</p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp can do that research and analysis to find the answers for you. That can be anything from surveys to record-combing.  EntrepreTemp can do the due diligence on a target market to analyze its viability and give recommendations on how to proceed.</p>
        
        
        <h2 id="sec5">Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Don't know if you need a customer analysis, market research, data analysis or competitor analysis?  EntrepreTemp will use strategy techniques to give you an answer.</p>
        <p>
          EntrepreTemp uses the techniques that some of the highest priced consultants use, and we apply them to our clients at a fraction of the cost.</p>
